      title: "What is a Component?",
      description: "Components are the fundamental building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI. Think of them like custom, super-powered HTML tags. You build a complex UI by composing simple components together.",

          code: `function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;

      description: "Static components are not very interactive. 'State' is data that a component can hold and change over time. When the state changes, the component automatically re-renders to display the new data. The `useState` hook is the primary way to add state to function components.",

      description: "What if your component needs to do something that isn't directly related to rendering, like fetching data from an API, setting a timer, or manually changing the DOM? These actions are called 'side effects'. The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects from within your function components.",

          description: "This component uses `useEffect` to update the document's title every time the `count` state changes. The array `[count]` at the end is the 'dependency array'â€”it tells React to only re-run the effect if `count` has changed.",
