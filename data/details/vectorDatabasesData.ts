  title: "Vector Databases Explained",
  description: "A vector database is a specialized database designed to store, manage, and search high-dimensional vectors. In the context of AI, these vectors are 'embeddings'â€”numerical representations of text, images, or other data. They are the core infrastructure that powers semantic search, recommendation engines, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).",

      title: "What is a Vector Embedding?",
      description: "An embedding is a list of numbers (a vector) that captures the semantic meaning of a piece of data. An embedding model converts your raw data (like a text chunk) into this vector format. The key idea is that similar concepts will have vectors that are numerically close to each other.",
      examples: [
        {
          description: "Conceptually, an embedding model maps words or sentences to points in a high-dimensional space.",
          code: `// Text with similar meanings produce similar vectors
get_embedding("The cat sat on the mat.") -> [0.1, 0.8, 0.2, ...]
get_embedding("A feline was on the rug.") -> [0.12, 0.78, 0.21, ...]

// Text with a different meaning produces a very different vector
get_embedding("The stock market is up.") -> [0.9, 0.3, 0.6, ...]`

    {
      title: "How Do Vector Databases Work?",
      description: "Vector databases store these embedding vectors and use specialized algorithms (Approximate Nearest Neighbor - ANN) to find the 'closest' vectors to a given query vector. This is much more powerful than traditional keyword search because it finds results based on conceptual meaning, not just word overlap.",

// stored vectors to find the top K closest matches.
